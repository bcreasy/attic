______________________________

to compile, run `g++ -o final final-0.3.cpp include/apstring.cpp'

i have included the older semi-stable versions of this program to see how i
have progressed :)

passengers.txt is a good copy of the passenger list to keep if we segfault
or lock up ( there is no reason why this should happen, but to be on the
		safe side )

WARNING: if you quit without pressing "q" at the main menu of this program,
you will lose the passenger list ( file: passenger )

enjoy
